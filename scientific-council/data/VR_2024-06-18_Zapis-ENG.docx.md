-   Pror. Zbyněk Škvor informed about the planned evaluation of science
    in 2025 and specified the schedule. The names of the committee
    members/commissioners are to be approved by the KHV by 10/1/2025.

> The faculty need to define the operational area between May and August
> next year, with a roughly one-week \"On-site visit\" expected.

-   QS ranking for 2025 - in the new QS World University Ranking CTU has
    advanced the most among the leading Czech universities and remains
    the best TU in the Czech Republic. Ranked 420th, it has improved by
    34 positions and is one of CTU\'s highest rankings since 2013.

-   Discussion about publishing in MDPI - Prof. Jex informed that e.g.
    in Slovakia there is a ban on publishing in MDPI. Prof. Hájek said
    that one cannot dehumanize someone for publishing older articles. In
    the future, it is expected that boundaries and new rules will be set
    for both articles and reviews. The CTU will modify the internal
    regulations. Prof. Dvořáková referred to the possible cooperation
    with the library and thus to check the suitability of articles for
    publication.

-   The next ordinary meeting of the CoR will take place on 22 October
    2024
