2.  **DSP - accreditation expiring 31 December 2024 - information was
    provided by the Vice-Rector. ŠKVOR**

> The date is set directly by the wording of the Act and cannot be moved
> except by amendment. At the time of the adoption of this regulation,
> the legislator assumed that Act 111/1998 Coll. would be amended by the
> deadline in order to allow for transfer to another related programme
> accredited for a longer period of time, if necessary. This amendment
> has now been resubmitted to the Parliament of the Czech Republic.
> Whether it will be valid and effective in time cannot be said with
> certainty at this point. There is still a year left to defend
> dissertations in existing degree programmes. If the study and living
> conditions allow, the dissertations should be submitted before the end
> of June 2024, which will allow the study to be concluded within the
> validity period of the accreditation, fully under the existing
> conditions. Should it not be possible to submit and defend the
> dissertation by the end of 2024, the further course of action will
> depend on the wording and effective date of the approved amendment to
> the Higher Education Act. The CTU is closely monitoring the
> development of the situation and will report on it.
