2.  **- Habilitation, Prof. Škvor -** Vice-Rector Škvor followed up on
    the last discussion at the SC meeting in October. The information
    was carried over to the meeting of the R&D Vice-Deans. Pror. Škvor
    reported on the successful habilitants in 2022, of which there were
    35 in total, and also prepared an analysis on the length of the
    internship abroad. The result he reported was not the best. There
    was again a wide-ranging discussion, from which various opinions,
    often conflicting, emerged. It was also pointed out that, in
    addition to the length of the internship abroad, the quality of the
    internship should also be taken into account. It might be useful to
    look at the criteria set at the University of Applied Sciences and
    the UK. A statement from the habilitation committee will be
    necessary for foreign internships. The Rector concluded the
    discussion by saying that he would meet with the deans and negotiate
    a consensus, describe the form and present the result to the CTU SC.

3.  **- Prof. Wald** pointed out that no proposal from CTU had been sent
    to the Czech Head, nominations for next year need to be looked
    after.

4.  **- pror. Škvor** the Rector\'s Awards Evaluation Committee for 2022
    will take place on 12/12/2023 on line (the committee consisting of
    Prof. Škvor, Prof. Matas, Prof. Jex).
