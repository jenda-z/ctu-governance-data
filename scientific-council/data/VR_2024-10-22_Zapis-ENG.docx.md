> **Re 6.3**

Rector doc. Petráček informed about the analysis carried out by Prof.
Ing Milan Jirásek, DrSc., member of the REC. Compared to other
universities, CTU is not doing well in terms of publication and citation
activity. It is worth mentioning in particular the different trend of
CTU in comparison with Brno University of Technology. There are very
open discussions at the RVH as to why this is happening, what are the
possible deviations that need to be corrected.
