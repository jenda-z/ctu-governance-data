The Vice-Rector Prof. Zbyněk Škvor informed the CTU Council about the
draft rules for transferring students from doctoral study programmes
with accreditation ending in 2024.

The HEI is obliged to ensure the completion of a degree in a similar
field. Branch Councils have prepared conversion tables. The method of
procedure has been negotiated with NAU, the Rector said. Tables from the
FJFI and Klokner Institute have now been submitted, the others will be
submitted at the next regular SC meeting on 18 June 2024.

This is a traditional document that was prepared by Assoc. Kramaříková.
The document was discussed at the AGM on 21/05/2024. There will be some
adjustments in the charts.

Opened a discussion on the discussion of the 2023 AGM of the CTU: Prof.
Ripka:

Pg. 186 - avg. monthly income of DS students - correct average instead
of total - rector said will be corrected

Pg. 214-215, VR agenda, foreign citizenship, need to add a comment in
the text section

Pg. 220 - appointment of associate professors and professors - average
age correct

Pg. 222, 7.1 - numbers of outgoing students, add description to table

p\. 230, table 7.3 student mobility - doubt on FS, FA and FBMI data -
need to check

p\. 236 - transfer of knowledge and research results to practice -
important indicator - CTU is ranked 1st in HEIs

Pages 238 and 239 - redundant data given

p\. 240, table 8.6 and other tables - absolutely fine processing

p\. 253 - decrease in quartiles of publication

Pg. 255 - alarming figure of 15% year-on-year drop in grants (reason for
the drop in JAC projects)

Query - students are encouraged to do research work from 1st year but
what about funding for undergraduate students in the Student Grant
Competition - Pror. Shkvor stated that the current Rules allow only PhD
and Masters students to participate.

The CTU Annual Report for 2023 was discussed with comments by the CTU
Scientific Council.

> **Ad 8/Miscellaneous**

-   The Rector expressed strong support for the accreditation of the SP
    Biomedical Nanotechnology (it is a multidisciplinary field)

-   Vice-Rector Škvor drew the attention of the deans to the sharp
    decline in proposals for professor appointments. 1 proposal will be
    presented at the June 18, 2024 regular SC meeting.

-   Prof. Jelínková - there are reports in the press that some associate
    professors and professors have obtained their degrees fraudulently.
    She asked the Rector that CTU and other technical universities
    should speak out, as this could worsen the reputation of the
    universities. The rector informed that he and other rectors of
    research universities were already preparing statements. The matter
    needs to be well presented in the media to be effective. He pointed
    out that CTU has processes and criteria well set up, in particular
    the committees need to evaluate the proposals responsibly so that
    the HEIs are able to monitor the quality of the field themselves.
    This is a general problem not only in the Czech Republic but also
    abroad. Prof. Dvořáková said that this is caused, among other
    things, by the setting of the government policy on science and
    research; it would be necessary to increase institutional support.
    There was a discussion about publishing in predatory journals and
    publishing in MDPI. Dr. Drábová pointed out that the problem was
    also systemic.
