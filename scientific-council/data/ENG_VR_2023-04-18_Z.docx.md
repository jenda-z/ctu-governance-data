-   **MDPI publications - commented by the Pror. Škvor. There had been
    extensive discussions at the R & D Vice-Deans\' meetings, most
    recently on 4 April 2023 . It had emerged that the Habilitation and
    Appointment Committees should comment on all publications of the
    candidate in order to meet the criteria, so no exclusion or special
    provision for MDPI was being considered at this time. Vice-Rector
    Škvor will send the evaluation of Prof. Vobecký and Prof. Dušek
    (with their approval) for review and wait for comments from both
    faculty and CoR members. After the evaluation, the Rector\'s Order
    could possibly be modified, adding MDPI after Beall\'s list among
    the publications on which the committee always comments. Provost.
    Škvor mentioned that also currently some MDPI journals were being
    excluded from WOS. If an adjustment is made, the Rector issues an
    order after discussion in the AS CTU. The removal of publications
    from the WOS should also be monitored, which has always been an
    important signal.**

-   **The Rector responded to a query about the increase in salary funds
    for HEIs. He**

> **provided more details from the CQC meeting where there is a push for
> a systemic solution that is unified by all rectors.**
