-   Vice-Rector Škvor informed about the University\'s preparation for
    the international MEP evaluation, which will take place in June. The
    Vice-Rector also asked the representatives of the faculties and
    institutes to think about possible additional programmes for the MEP
    members during the week - a visit to the nuclear reactor, the Josef
    Tunnel and others.

-   The Rector opened the topic - improving publication and citation
    activity, which was discussed at the AGM and earlier SC meetings,
    including the issue of motivation and funding. Representatives of
    other universities who are external members of the CoR also shared
    their views. The Rector invited to think about a new methodology
    that could be better implemented in faculties and units. Tables
    would help to break down habilitants and professors by discipline.
